# setup.

First, head to https://discord.com/channels/1038575674899841044/1107046001061142681/1145075194818474074 and install tesseract.

While installing note down the path it says it is being installed in, then finish.

Once, done take that path and add "\tesseract.exe" to the end of it.

Now, install the files above (dum.py and the others) and open that folder.

After opening, right click the top and edit the address.

After that type "cmd" and enter

You should end up in a command line.

**Do not just open cmd through your search bar as it will not work. I warned you**

In the command line do "pip install requests colorama clipboard pygame pytesseract pillow" and wait for those to install.

After you are done, open "config.json" and take the tesseract path you made earlier, and set it as that.

Now, open "tyd.json" and input a **user** token where it says "bot_token:". 

You do not know how to get your user token? Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI . 

At this point, in your command line you can do "python dum.py" and it would start watching the set channel.

Now, if you want to make sure that it works, go to your discord settings and turn on developer mode. You should then see that on right clicking a channel, you can copy the channel id. I trust you can tell what to do with that.

Now, on click the 3 dots on a user's profile, you can copy their user ID. You can do this with the typedummy bot.
